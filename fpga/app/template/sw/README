GETTING STARTED

First copy openocd/ to host system with Corundum PCIe endpoint runs.
Then in openocd/ run make to build and run the OpenOCD GDB server.

On (same or other) host cross RISC-V GDB debugger and use
"target extended-remote <corundum-host-ip>:3333".

make debug to build the application, upload it to the RISC-V via
OpenOCD GDB server -> PCIe XVC -> JTAG -> VexRiscv -> BRAM, start
the CPU and break at main().

The RISC-V toolchain can be downloaded prebuilt. See this VexRiscv
Dockerfile for all VexRiscv related tools.
