Facet is a SoC written in, and generated by SpinalHDL.

- VexRiscv RISC-V CPU with I$ and D$
- AXI4Shared (shared AW/AR) sparse crossbar
- D$ bus connected to crossbar
- I$ bus connected to crossbar
- I$ master is read-only, and can connect to RAM only.
- one AXI4-Full master interface exposed
- 64 kiB BRAM for code and data connected to crossbar
- a AXI4Shared to APB bridge with these APB slaves
  - APB timer
  - APB UART
  - APB GPIO

git clone --branch Facet https://github.com/likewise/VexRiscv VexRiscv.Facet
cd VexRiscv.Facet/ && git checkout 5bd3261f58423a6c17866c92fab156f91d2055ce

To generate the Facet.v Verilog implementation, SpinalHDL needs to be set up.
See the SpinalHDL or VexRiscv documentation.

sbt "runMain vexriscv.demo.FacetWithMemoryInit"
or "make rtl"

Alternative to installing SpinalHDL (and dependencies such as Scala) is to use
a Docker image. 

Or build then use this Docker image which has the tools installed:

git checkout https://github.com/likewise/vexriscv-dockerfile
cd vexriscv-dockerfile && git checkout 5538b51c853586d1c7f43a14debd040ec8f2576c
make build

cd VexRiscv.Facet/
make -f ../vexriscv-dockerfile/Makefile run

sbt "runMain vexriscv.demo.FacetWithMemoryInit"


OR as a one-liner:

docker run -i --rm -v $PWD:/home/vexriscv/project -w /home/vexriscv/project vexriscv:latest sbt "runMain vexriscv.demo.FacetWithMemoryInit"
