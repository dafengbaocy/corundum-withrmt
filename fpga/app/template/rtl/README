Finka is a SoC written in, and generated by SpinalHDL.

- VexRiscv RISC-V CPU with I$ and D$
- AXI4Shared (shared AW/AR) sparse crossbar
- D$ bus connected to crossbar
- I$ bus connected to crossbar
- I$ master is read-only, and can connect to RAM only.
- one AXI4-Full master interface exposed
- 64 kiB BRAM for code and data connected to crossbar
- a AXI4Shared to APB bridge
  - APB timer
  - APB UART
  - APB GPIO

git clone --branch Finka https://github.com/likewise/VexRiscv VexRiscv.Finka
cd VexRiscv.Finka/ && git checkout fd8dde93f922fc812a56d3b53a2b1098901e871a

To generate the Finka.v Verilog implementation, SpinalHDL needs to be set up.
See the SpinalHDL or VexRiscv documentation.

sbt "runMain vexriscv.demo.FinkaWithMemoryInit"


Alternative to installing SpinalHDL (and dependencies such as Scala) is to use
a Docker image. 

Or build then use this Docker image which has the tools installed:

git checkout https://github.com/likewise/vexriscv-dockerfile
cd vexriscv-dockerfile && git checkout 5538b51c853586d1c7f43a14debd040ec8f2576c
make build

cd VexRiscv.Finka/
make -f ../vexriscv-dockerfile/Makefile run

sbt "runMain vexriscv.demo.FinkaWithMemoryInit"


OR as a one-liner:

docker run -i --rm -v $PWD:/home/vexriscv/project -w /home/vexriscv/project vexriscv:latest sbt "runMain vexriscv.demo.FinkaWithMemoryInit"
